# 🧠 Neural Network From Scratch

A lightweight neural network framework built **from scratch in Python**.  
No TensorFlow. No PyTorch. Just pure math, gradients, and learning.

This project is designed to deeply understand how neural networks work internally by implementing all core components manually.
